This repository contain my personal website built using [React Js](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Packages

I used [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) CSS to make the layouts, SCSS to customize the look, and [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) for the social icons at the button of my intro.

## Example
